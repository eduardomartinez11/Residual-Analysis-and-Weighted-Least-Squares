# Residual-Analysis-and-Weighted-Least-Squares

This is my work for a homework assignmdng completed while taking "Applied Statistics &amp; Regression", a graduate course that I completed at Illinois Institute of Technology. 

Many problems come from the following textbook: 
Chatterjee, S., &amp; Hadi, A.S. (2012). Regression Analysis by Example. 5th Edition.
